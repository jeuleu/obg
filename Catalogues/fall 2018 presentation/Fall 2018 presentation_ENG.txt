Materials and Packaging are among the most distinctive features that characterize O bag products
- silicone is food-safe silicone, an artificial material consisting of a silicon base (a natural 
element present in sand) and oxygen. It is a high-quality material, compliant with food 
regulations, completely non-toxic, odourless and tasteless, non-stick, elastic, and resistant to 
ageing and high temperatures.
- Materiale  XL Extralight ® is a special plastic material with many different features: it is 
lightweight, flexible, colourful and versatile, with a special “soft touch” effect. It is also 
resistant to water, UV rays, chlorine and salt water and retains its colour over time. In 
addition, it is washable, does not allow bacteria to proliferate and respects the environment 
as it does not contain solvents harmful to health.
• materials represent a distinctive element for O bag: all the products are produced from 
a combination of Silicone and Materiale XL Extralight ®
• packaging is one of the strong selling points of the O bag value proposition, which 
makes O bag's products suitable for gifting
• the packaging adds value to purchase giving it the premium feel

DISTRIBUTION
Distribution has been a critical success factor for O bag and a strong element of differentiation vs. competitors
Monobrand network Capillary distribution In-store experience
• O bag was born as a 
company focused on 
wholesale channel
• Product portfolio evolved 
towards multiple categories 
which are sold on different 
channels: need for more 
control to limit dirty distribution
• Monobrand has been 
fundamental to display O bag 
full offer, foster cross selling 
across categories and control 
the channel (prices, brand 
image)
.fall 2018 COLLECTIONBrand .the brand values – distribution
• Network of 400 stores with a 
capillary presence on the Italian 
market
- 197 stores in Italy of which 80 
DOS and 117 franchising
• Targeted concept store with a 
clear positioning:
- Mall or city center store 
(high traffic location)
- Small size (25-30smq)
• Creation of "Beach" store format 
to target leisure destination
• Unique customer experience: 
customer can customize its 
product in store
- Most of players propose a 
customized offer only on-line 
or delivering the product 
later on
• Monobrands offer multiple 
opportunities for cross selling:
- Many product categories are 
low ticket (bracelets, 
watches) easy to cross sell
O bag evolved towards a monobrand distribution model, achieving more control on all categories

Brand .the brand values – distribution
• Each product category has a dedicated wholesale network:
- Different stores, specialized in a single category
- Many independent players, difficult to manage/control
• New products require a different distribution strategy:
- Impossibility to promote a different category in the same 
channel (e.g. bag in a custom jewellery stores)  
- Adding a network of agents targeting a different type of 
stores (e.g. apparel multibrand)
• Creating a monobrand network allows to:
- Have more control of distribution (marks down, 
brand, etc.)
- Cross sell categories
- Avoid network duplication or selling the product in 
the wrong channel 
Monobrand network has reached over 197 POS in Italy, with different locations and format
