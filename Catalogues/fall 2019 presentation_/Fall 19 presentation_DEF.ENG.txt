O Bag Brand Trend
Trend motivation O bag
Actions
Market Trend – Retail Segment
• General turbulence in European
markets
• Change of attitude of the final 
consumer that changes the 
consumption’s trend 
• New balance between online sales 
and physical in-store sales
8 months of promotion activities and 
4 months of sales
High turbolence in retail channel
O bag Market Trend
New Markets
Mature Markets
• High demand of O bag products
• Development plan: growth
2018 for the brand it is characterized by a two-speed trend
• Sales Standardization
• The adjustment speed of the trend is directly 
proportional to the success of the brand in the 
launch phase
• spontaneous and growing demand for opening 
new markets
Trend Motivation - Network O bag
little depth of stocks of the best sellers 
and continuous
error in the programmed order sent and in the communication 
of the season budget.
taking into consideration only the programmed orders the  
consequence is a programming error of the company in the 
production launch 
Deliveries Delays
Production Problems (Soft line)
Sales campaigns indefinitely opened – no certain closure date
customers with little respect for the rules do not place 
scheduled orders and face the seasons with restocking 
campaign, subtracting products from others
