visual guidelines
visual guidelines ss 2017: criticality
first: there is a wrong interpretation of the in-store planning:
5 colors instead of 18 
low shopping experience
reduced the timing in store of the products
no reorders
no focus on the essential – carry over items
visual guidelines
second: each theme doesn’t last only for the period of its relevant
window:
the three themes of the spring collection mark out the shops until Easter event
the window project and the pop materials highlights the themes in-store
after Easter the items of the spring collection will propose again as further reorders
for the summer collection
visual guidelines
three: store zone:
the parcom is meant for the product focus or the essential focus
the tillside is meant to display shapes, colors, watches and bracelets
dedicated sunglasses display
the boiserie is meant to display the themes
the central elements are meant to display bags, wallets and accessories
visual guidelines
it is necessary to display in permanent areas icons – essentials – carry
over items
back to the DNA of the brand – dedicated zone
new visual guidelines fw ‘17
new elements for the function merchandising
we are introducing new elements like turnable stands in order to present
the same category products (canvas, handles etc.)

Il presente lavoro nasce dalla forte esigenza di fare chiarezza organizzativa in ambito Retail
evidenziando per ogni figura al suo interno i compiti, le responsabilità, gli obiettivi ed i parametri di
valutazione con cui sarà giudicata. Rappresenta il punto di partenza per definire poi le modalità di
interazione con le altre funzioni aziendali che a vario titolo sono coinvolte nel Retail. Lo step successivo
sarà quello di creare dei gruppi multifunzionali che lavoreranno appunto sui processi trasversali
Il lavoro si suddivide nelle due seguenti parti:
As Is – struttura organizzativa 
attuale
To be – struttura 
organizzativa suggerita per il 
futuro
Il modello a tendere prevede la costruzione della struttura dell’assortimento (lista degli ingredienti) per
cluster di negozi ad opera di Planner, Merchandiser e Prodotto e la definizione dell’assortimento
(dosaggio degli ingredienti con eventuali piccole aggiunte) a carico degli Store Manager con supporto
dei propri District Manager
