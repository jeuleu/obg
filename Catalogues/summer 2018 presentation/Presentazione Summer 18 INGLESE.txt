focus on customer
shopping experience
customer wants personalization, wants to express himself
the O bag product is a unique product because it is first of all
custom-made (key success)
It is necessary rethink the approach:
start thinking about what the customer wants, not what you
want to sell
customer-driven strategy
piano sviluppo
builds loyalty
why customer experience is important:
helps retain customers
but it must offer value
it needs to be consistent from the initial engagement of the
customers attention, all the way through to after sales support
shopping experience
piano sviluppo
no focus on the customer experience :
already composed product offer
limited personalization is dangerous: shop no more as lab concept
first stock, rather than the whole assortment
low attention to the ritual of purchase (phase ante/post)
(i.e.: no use the dedicated pop)
