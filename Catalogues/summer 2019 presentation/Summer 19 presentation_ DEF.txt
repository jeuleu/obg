Case history – P.o.S Palermo Center 
Forum
.summer 2019 COLLECTION
Feedback of May 2018:
1. The shop didn’t appeal the costumers; It wasn’it focused on the product 
2. There wasn’t interest in the costumers to enter and visit the shop, which seems empty compared to 
our competitors
3. The costumers hadn’t got an easy access to the concept, because the layout didn’t allow that
4. There wasn’t enough space for a good product exhibition, specifically the SOFT line
Case history – Palermo Center Forum .summer 2019 COLLECTION
Action
1. New furnitures positioning created a right layout which allow a fine shop visiting, with a new 
dedicated place for the SOFT line products, in the center of the shop.
2. In order to attract the costumers to new concept of the SOFT products, we hang some of them on 
the wall at the end of the shop
3. The E10 sunglasses display has been eliminated
4. A new merchandising was made in order to make a better presentation of the “best sellers” and 
their prices
5. We put bags, long and soft handles over all the stands in the shop
6. We have completed the shop windows with sunglasses and clocks, linked to the bags in store
The shop has increased its sells trend ( in the 2017 was -27%, now is -5%)
